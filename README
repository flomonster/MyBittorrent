# Introduction

MyBittorrent is a barebone torrent client aiming at providing a basic
implementation of the bittorrent protocol, using a sane project architecture.


# Installing

You can build the project using:

```sh
./bootstrap
./configure
make
```

You may install it using:

```
make install
```


# Usage

```sh
$ ./my-bittorrent --help
Usage: my-bittorrent [--verbose] [--seed] COMMAND
where  COMMAND := { --dump-peers | --pretty-print-torrent-file | { torrents } }
```

`--dump-peers` prints the initial list of peers returned by the tracker

`--pretty-print-torrent-file` prints a JSON dump of the bencoded torrent file

Beware that seeding isn't yet implemented.
